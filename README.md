# carbon-crush
An app to increase awareness of how we can all reduce our carbon footprint
Contains Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Flask. 
Users can take the Quiz (created in Python) to calculate their carbon footprint and commit to pledges and actions to help reduce their carbon emmissions. 
Users can participate as individuals or join as part of a team and compete against others on the leaderboard.
This project was created as part of CodeFirstGirls X Beazley 2021 Hackathon. This was a 2 week hackathon, as a result some elements were created to asthetically show how we intend the project to work and do not yet interact with each other.
