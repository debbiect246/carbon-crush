            <h2>Myth VS. Science</h2>
            <h5><b>Myth 1. The climate has changed before so we do not need to worry</b></h5>
            <h5><p>It is true that the climate has hugely changed over the course of itâ€™s 4.5 billion year existence. However, the climate responds to whatever forces it to change at the time, and currently humans are the dominant influence.</p></h5>

        <div>
            <h5><b>Myth 2. Climate change is a future problem</b></h5>
            <h5><p>We are already seeing the devastating effects of climate change, it is the biggest environmental challenge humanity has ever seen. Climate change is already adversely affecting the oceans, human health, agriculture, sea level, biodiversity and the economy.</p></h5>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h5><b>Myth 3. Climate models are unreliable</b></h5>
            <h5><p>Climate models are mathematical representations of major drivers of climate, including the atmosphere, oceans, land and ice which can be used to recreate past climate or predict future climate. Many models have accurately projected changes in global surface temperature.</p></h5>
